# Deep Learning for Hand Gesture and Arabic Sign Language Recognition

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook implementation of deep learning models for hand gesture and Arabic sign language recognition. This project was presented at the 4th BİLSEL International TRUVA Scientific Research Congress in Çanakkale, Turkey.

**Key Features:**

* **Deep Learning:** Advanced techniques for accurate gesture recognition.
* **Computer Vision:** Processing and analyzing image and video data.
* **Sign Language Recognition:** Recognizing signs from the Arabic alphabet.

**To Run the Notebook:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/hunter123520/Arabic-Gesture-Prediction]
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

3. **Run the notebook:** Open **Arabic Gesture Prediction.ipynb** in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
